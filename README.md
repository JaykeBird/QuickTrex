# QuickTrex
A quick and simple localization program, for usage by small/hobbyist developers!

QuickTrex is short for "quick translation experience". It lacks the advanced features found in more professional offerings, but for when you just want to start out with something small and tiny, this may work for you!

## Features
* Organize strings into categories
* Write translations in your language while seeing the text in the original language
* Export to XML, JSON, XAML ResourceDictionary, CSV, and more!

## Release requirements
To use QuickTrex, you need to have:

* .NET Framework 4.5
* Windowws 7 or later
* like... maybe 10 MB of free space? not even?

## Development requirements
To develop QuickTrex, you need to have Visual Studio 2017 and all the stuff above.

You could maybe be okay with an earlier version of Visual Studio, but no guarantees!

## Changelog
