Greetings! Write the issue or feedback you'd like here, **but first**:

To help me help you, please keep in mind a few things.

- If this is feedback or just a general comment, I'll probably give a response and then "close" the comment. If there's nothing actionable (i.e. something to fix, something to add, etc.), then there's no reason to keep it open.
- If this is a suggestion, do note that not all suggestions will make it in. I'll probably talk with you about it a bit, and if I reject it, I'll say why. QuickTrex is meant to be kept pretty simple, so I don't want to bog the program down.
- If this is an issue/problem you're reporting, please tell me the following things:
  - What version of Windows you have
  - What version of QuickTrex you have (go to Help > About, and see there)
  - What language you're using, if using a non-English version of Windows
- If your suggestion or problem has already been reported by someone else, I may "close" your issue as a duplicate, and link to the first report. Please direct your attention to that first report instead.

Alright, now that you've read this all, you can select all this text, delete it, and write what you need. Hope I can help!
